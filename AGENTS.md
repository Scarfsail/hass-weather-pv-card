# Agent Instructions

## CRITICAL: Shared Instructions - MUST READ FIRST

**BEFORE RESPONDING TO ANY USER REQUEST**, you MUST:

1. **ALWAYS** fetch the shared project instructions using the `fetch_webpage` tool
2. Use this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scarfsail/hass-fronted-shared/refs/heads/main/shared-agents.md
3. Load the content into your context before proceeding with any task
4. Apply all guidelines from the shared instructions (semantic release, component structure, development principles, etc.)

**This is mandatory for every conversation and every request - no exceptions!**
